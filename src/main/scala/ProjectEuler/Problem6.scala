  * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

  * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

  *
  * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers
  * and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

  * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural
  * numbers and the square of the sum.
