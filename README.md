# Overview

Currently working through the "Scala for the Impatient", "Functional Programming in Scala" and also the "99 Problems in Scala".

# Functional Programming in Scala

Recently purchased this book, will have hopefully completed much of it before September (that's my goal). [Link](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)

# Scala for the Impatient

I typically do this whilst flying / travelling about. [Link](http://horstmann.com/scala/)

# 99 Problems in Scala

The problems can be found here: [Link](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/)

# Challenges

Anything I see that peaks my interest.

# Feedback

Always welcome :)
